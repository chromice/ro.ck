I started this project a year ago, when I purchased my monome. I needed a way to bridge OSC inputs (monome and potentially other devices) with any OSCâ€“enabled music app. But then I bought an iPad and it rendered this project useless to me for the foreseeable future, because I find it more rewarding to actually make music in the plethora of music apps for iOS.

At the moment only monome driver and related controls (push, toggle and radio grids and standalone LEDs) have been implemented. At some point, I may implement TouchOSC controls and make a few examples.

In order to start using this piece of code: shred the `import.ck`, which will import all classes; connect your monome 64; make sure that the correct port is set in `test_monome.ck` and shred it as well. It used to work in ChucK 1.2.x.x (Dracula). GL. ;-)
